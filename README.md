# HotelReservation

# **Project Overview** <br/>
The Hotel Reservation System is a multithreaded client-server application built using Java and JavaFX. The system allows users to make reservations and view reservation details dynamically, handling multiple clients simultaneously through a multithreaded server setup. This project demonstrates my understanding of multithreading, networking, and UI/UX design.

# **Features**<br/>
Multithreaded Server: Handles multiple clients concurrently using ServerSocket and Socket classes, with each client running on a separate thread.
Dynamic UI Updates: UI components update in real-time based on changes in the data model using JavaFX property bindings.
Synchronization Across Views: Ensures consistent data display across multiple views via property bindings.
Robust Input Validation: Validates user inputs and handles exceptions, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Client-Server Communication: Uses ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream for serialized object communication.
Intuitive JavaFX UI: Responsive and visually appealing user interface.
